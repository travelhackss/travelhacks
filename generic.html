						<p>Discover our three countries : Thailand, Mexico, France</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Thailand</h2>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" height="500" width="200" alt="" /></a>
					<p>There are several Thailand. First, Bangkok, megacity hyperactive and urban monster where we get lost with pleasure. Then the South, its islands, its beaches, its spicy food, its mentality a little different. Finally, North Thailand, deep, original with its ancient founding kingdoms, relaxed pace of life, its Buddhist temples and mountains. Three Thailand so, physically and culturally different.</p>
<h2>Mexico</h2>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic15.jpg" height="500" width="200" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Like its capital, Mexico is a country bubbling, multiple and fascinating. A mythical land, which evokes at once the pre-Hispanic world, the adventure of the conquistadors, the revolution, the happy and colorful festivals. Many civilizations have succeeded each other in Mexico over the centuries, and were so rich that one can spend a lifetime studying the origins of the Olmecs the science of the Maya, the sportsmanship of the Toltecs or the organization military of the Aztecs.</p>
<h2>France</h2>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic16.jpg" height="500" width="200" alt="" /></a>
					<p>The world's leading tourist destination, France draws its strength from its cultural diversity and exceptional historical heritage. The 22 regions of France are home to multiple landscapes, each with its own traditions and culture. France is also famous all over the world for the quality of its gastronomy. First tourist destination in the world ... France has the difficult task of remaining among the favorite countries of tourists! And it ensures ... Who can claim to gather all the styles of landscapes, such as sea, mountain, countryside and urban, a cultural diversity and a heritage to any test, enriching ethnic mixtures, gastronomic specialties to make envy of envy the four corners of the earth and of course a warm welcome among 22 regions as beautiful as each other and four sumptuous DOM TOM. When we talk about "France" in the eyes of a tourist, Paris and the French Riviera will appear as obvious, a dream, but do not underestimate the hidden resources of this country, because at one end to the other, France has natural resources that make it what it is today, one of the most beautiful countries in the world!</p>
